                <h3>
                    Essential Campus Resources
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Getting to know a new college is a big task. In our focus on roommates and dorm furnishings, choosing classes and ordering textbooks, we sometimes forget that our first-year students will also need to become familiar with an entirely new physical space. At home, they can find their way from point A to point B with their eyes closed, but now they must chart pathways from their residence hall to their meals to their classes and back again.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Those very basic needs will get met first. But then comes a more complex navigation: locating the campus resources that will help them be successful. The wise student will use every tool available, but asking others for help isn’t always easy. Assure your student that, although you will be there for emotional support, they should use the many resources available on campus to help them succeed.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Professors
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Professors teach classes, but they also set aside office hours to get to know students and to provide help. Unfortunately, few students take advantage of this one-on-one time with the professor. Some students find the prospect of talking to the professor intimidating, but it’s worth overcoming the hesitation. Using office hours gives students a chance to get to know the professor and get individual attention and targeted help with course material.

                <h4>
                    Academic Advisor
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    An academic advisor is the person assigned to help your student make important academic decisions such as choosing a major, selecting appropriate classes, staying on track for their degree, and navigating the college curriculum. An academic advisor can be a wonderful partner in your student’s academic career, but only if they take advantage of the advisor’s guidance. Working with an advisor can ensure that your student makes informed choices and decisions.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Tutoring or Writing Center
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Most tutoring centers offer help in many subjects and provide both professional and peer tutoring services. Peer tutors have done well in the subjects that they tutor and can understand the struggles that students encounter. Writing centers offer students help with organizing and editing papers. Working with a tutor can help your student build confidence and study skills, and can provide accountability to help them keep up with assignments.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    College Library
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Beyond the many online services, internet resources and databases offered by the campus library, a visit to the physical building can uncover additional resources. Libraries offer quiet study spaces that will suit students who are easily distracted or disturbed by the noise and commotion in their residence hall. Most also offer group study areas where students can work with others on projects or exam preparation. The expertise of the librarians can help guide students through essential research steps and help them to discover and access unfamiliar resources.

                <h4>
                    Campus Health Center
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Campus health centers are no longer the old fashioned school infirmary. Most contemporary health centers offer onsite medical and counseling services as well as general wellness education. Increasingly, campus health centers offer expanded services to help students deal with stress, anxiety and other mental health issues. Encourage your student to seek physical or psychological help if they need it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    Career Center
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The career center on most campuses is far more than a job placement office and should be on your student’s list of places to visit in the first year. Most of today’s career offices can help your student choose a major, explore careers within a chosen major, discover strengths and talents, find on- and off-campus jobs, and seek out internships. Career centers also offer help with resume building, interviewing skills, and workplace expectations. The career center can be an important link between your student’s academic work and their future career.

                <h3>
                    Support System: The Key for Success
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Your social support system is a network of people you trust and look to for guidance. Our immediate support networks often include our family and friends, but students can also look to their classmates, professors and advisors for additional help.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    College is the perfect time to develop meaningful relationships with new people and to strengthen the relationships you already have. You’ll face both big and small challenges throughout your academic and professional career, and it’s important to have people to lean on in times of need.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In addition to assistance in making friends and identifying new mentors, your support system can help you:
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    Handle difficult situations
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When obstacles inevitably arise, we sometimes need a little help keeping our goals in perspective. The people in your support network will be there for you when you need to talk after a long day, or when you’re feeling overwhelmed with work, school or your other obligations. Supportive friends, family, professors and colleagues will celebrate your successes and help you learn from your failures, providing the encouragement that you need to meet each challenge with determination and a positive attitude.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    Find needed resources
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Your professors and advisors can be invaluable resources to you throughout your college career and after you graduate. With expertise in their respective fields, the faculty at your university can offer you sage career and academic advice. They can also help you develop your professional network, and may even be willing to write a recommendation letter for you in the future. Take advantage of your professors’ office hours and talk to them about your dreams, goals and challenges. They’ll help you figure out which steps you need to take to be successful, both academically and professionally.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    Get motivated
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Forming relationships with your classmates and your peers will help you stay engaged in your coursework and motivate you to succeed. If you are ever overwhelmed or struggling in school, the classmates in your support network will be willing to help you and offer their guidance, insight and strategies for success. You’ll benefit from working closely with others in your program and might even forge long-lasting friendships.
