                <p>
                    The UK has a reputation around the world as a country of learning and academia, and it’s not hard to see why. Universities have a centuries-old history in Britain, with Oxford and Cambridge both having been founded over 800 years ago! This is reflected in the modern world, with British universities taking many places in the world university league tables. In fact, 16% of the world’s top 100 universities are in the UK according to the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2022">QS World University Rankings 2022</a>!
