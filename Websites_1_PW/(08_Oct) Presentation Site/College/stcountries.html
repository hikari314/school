                <p>
                    One of the best countries to study abroad and work in 2021, Australia has a lot more to offer than just kangaroos, koalas, wide-open spaces, and beautiful beaches. Its friendly, laid-back nature and high standard of living are reasons why studying in Australia is a choice made by many international students. Another important factor that motivates international students to learn there is Australia’s education system.  Out of the top 100 universities in the world, eight of them are Australian universities. The country’s education system also focuses more on research-based work, making students study there to think outside the box. The annual tuition fee in Australia ranges between 20,00,000 and 25,00,000 for undergraduates and 25,00,000 and 45,00,000 for postgrads. And the cost of living in this country can be anywhere from 5,000 to 15,000 AUD.

                <p>
                    New Zealand might seem like a small island in the Pacific Ocean, but it’s so much more than that. Ranking high on the Global Peace Index, New Zealand offers a relaxed lifestyle and a perfect balance between modern life and beautiful nature. Not only that, but it also has a thriving economy. The country is known for its unique, hands-on learning approach and its opportunities to international students. This is why all the eight universities in New Zealand rank amongst the top 500 institutes of the world. Additionally, the cost of living in New Zealand will depend on your lifestyle and which part of the country you live in. But if you’re planning to study in New Zealand for less than a year, you should have at least $1,250 for each month of your stay.
