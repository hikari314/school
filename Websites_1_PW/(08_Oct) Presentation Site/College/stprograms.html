                    What is "Study Abroad"?
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “Study abroad” is a chance to pursue your college studies in a foreign country. Students attend lectures or carry out research at a foreign university or through their home university's study-abroad program. Participants typically live in a residence hall, apartment, or with a local family through a homestay. Some students enroll in an international program for a semester or a year, but others take the full plunge and earn their entire degrees in a different country.

                    Types of Programs
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Study abroad programs come in many different formats. You should choose the one that best suits your interests and goals. Below are some popular types of programs.

                <h4>
                    University-Led
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    American colleges and universities often administer a variety of study-abroad programs. They make agreements with higher education institutions abroad where American students can enroll, or they have their own study-abroad centers in the host country. Sometimes universities give students a set schedule of courses, but in other cases, learners must arrange their own schedules. This latter option usually involves asking professors to approve of these foreign courses so that the international credits can seamlessly transfer back to a student's home university.

                <br>
                <p>
                    These experiences often include prearranged housing and group trips around the country or continent. In countries with foreign languages, sometimes professors come from the U.S. to teach courses in English. Students who want to learn a foreign language can enroll in non-English-speaking courses as well.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    Third-Party Programs
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Organizations like the Council on International Educational Exchange and IES Abroad offer a wide range of programs for college learners. These experiences are usually structured, so students take required courses and stick with their student cohort for cultural experiences and weekend trips. These programs also usually organize accommodation for students and cover many day-to-day costs through required fees.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    Direct Enrollment
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Other opportunities allow students to integrate more fully into the home country's culture. They take courses with students from the host country, either in a foreign language or in English if they go to a country like England or Australia. Students also coordinate their own finances and housing. Learners who decide to pursue their entire degrees at a foreign university go this route, but students can sometimes enroll for a semester or year as well.
