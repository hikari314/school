                <h4>
                    Why I should study abroad?
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Studying abroad is a global phenomenon, with students crossing countries, continents and oceans to get the best education possible. But why has choosing to study at a university in another country become so popular? The truth is, studying overseas has many fantastic benefits, from helping you find a good job to improving your social life. Still not sure? Then here are the some reasons why you should study abroad.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    1. It’s a challenge
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It may seem a strange point to start off on, but it should be said that studying abroad isn’t necessarily easy. There are unique challenges that come with going overseas to study, but that’s all part of the fun and the experience. You may have some concerns before leaving your home country, but don’t worry: that’s completely natural. Stepping outside of your comfort zone is one of the things that makes the whole experience so valuable and worthwhile. After all, if you can travel overseas to study, you can do anything!
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    2. Experience a different culture
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest advantages of studying abroad for many international students is the chance to become immersed in a totally different environment. This enriching experience will enable you to see and do things you wouldn’t expect, and meet people who have grown up in a different culture. For instance, while living abroad you’ll be able to try new foods, hear traditional music, have a go at local activities and explore everything else your host country has to offer. It’s also fascinating to see your own culture through the eyes of somebody else’s – you can learn a lot about yourself and your home country this way!
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    3. Top quality education
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Of course, no matter where you study, your goal is always going to be to get the highest possible quality of education. Becoming an international student can greatly broaden your study options. After all, why be limited to choosing a university in your home country? Often, the best choice for you may be to study at a foreign university. For example, the USA, UK and Australia all have extremely highly regarded higher education systems, and a huge percentage of the world’s highest ranking universities are in these few countries.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    4. Learn a new language
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One huge benefit of studying abroad is the chance to learn a new language. Learning a language can be a real challenge, but there is nothing quite like living somewhere where that language is spoken natively. It really helps! Since English is such a universally used language, it can be quite advantageous to study in a country such as the USA or the UK. You’ll be able to study in English, speak to locals and really develop your language skills.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    5. Career opportunities
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Of course, the main reason for getting a degree in the first place is to improve your career prospects. In a globalised, well-connected world, employers increasingly value graduates with international experience and education. Studying abroad helps you to learn new languages, appreciate other cultures, overcome challenges of living in another country and gain a greater understanding of the world. These are all things that modern businesses look for when hiring, and such traits will only become more important in the future.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    6. Make new friends
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    No matter where you go to university, you’re sure to meet lots of new people and make new friends who are all in the same position as you. When you study abroad, you have a unique opportunity to make friends with people from all kinds of different cultures, and learn about other countries and customs. Many lifelong friendships start at university, and you’ll be able to live, learn and travel together during your studies. It can also be hugely beneficial to know people in different countries around the world – especially after you graduate!
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    7. International travel
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As well as experiencing the culture of your study destination, you will also be able to travel to other nearby countries. For example, if you go to a UK university, you can easily catch a flight to continental Europe to see Paris, Rome, Barcelona and many more fascinating places. Studying abroad is therefore a unique opportunity to see more of the world, which is itself a hugely rewarding and educational experience. There is no doubt that seeing other parts of the world will greatly affect your character and worldview, and help you prepare for life in a global society.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    8. Become independent
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It’s often said that going to university is when you become truly independent from your parents and family. This is especially true when you go to university in another country! Bringing us full circle, becoming independent is itself a challenge. But living and studying in another country will help shape you into an independent and adventurous adult, ready to succeed in your future career.
