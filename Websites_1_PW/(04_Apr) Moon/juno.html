    <p>
        Determine how much water is in Jupiter's atmosphere, which helps determine which planet formation theory is correct (or if new theories are needed); Look deep into Jupiter's atmosphere to measure composition, temperature, cloud motions and other properties; Map Jupiter's magnetic and gravity fields, revealing the planet's deep structure; Explore and study Jupiter's magnetosphere near the planet's poles, especially the auroras – Jupiter's northern and southern lights – providing new insights about how the planet's enormous magnetic force field affects its atmosphere.
